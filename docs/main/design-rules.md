## 1. The Mathematical & Layout Rules

These rules provide the structural foundation for your interface.

* **The 60-30-10 Color Rule:** Use 60% primary color (usually a neutral), 30% secondary color, and 10% accent color for call-to-action (CTA) elements.
* **The 8pt Grid System:** Use increments of 8 (8, 16, 24, 32...) for sizing, padding, and margins. This ensures perfect scaling across different screen resolutions.
* **Golden Ratio (1.618):** Use this ratio to determine font sizes or layout proportions (e.g., if your body text is 16px, your heading could be ).
* **The Rule of Thirds:** Divide your screen into a 3x3 grid and place important elements at the intersections to create a naturally balanced composition.

## 2. Core UX Psychology Laws

UX design is rooted in how the human brain processes information.

| Law | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Jakob’s Law** | Users spend most of their time on *other* sites. Design your interface to work in ways they are already familiar with. |
| **Hick’s Law** | The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices. Keep menus simple. |
| **Fitts’s Law** | The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target. Make buttons large and easy to reach. |
| **Miller’s Law** | The average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory. Group/chunk content together. |
| **Peak-End Rule** | Users judge an experience based on how they felt at its peak and its end, rather than the total average. |

## 3. Typography & Visual Hierarchy

Typography is 90% of design. If the text is hard to read, the UX fails.

* **The 2-Font Limit:** Avoid using more than two different font families. Use one for headings and one for body text to maintain cleanliness.
* **Line Height (Leading):** For optimal readability, set your line height to roughly **1.5x** (150%) of the font size.
* **Line Length:** Keep body text between **45–75 characters** per line. Anything longer tires the eyes.
* **Visual Anchor:** Use size, weight, and color to create a clear "entry point" for the user's eyes. The most important thing on the page should be the most visually distinct.

## 4. Interaction & Usability Rules

* **The 3-Click Rule:** A user should be able to find any information they need within three clicks of the homepage.
* **Affordance & Signifiers:** Interactive elements should *look* interactive. A button should look like it can be pressed (shadows, rounded corners); a link should look like it can be clicked (underlines, blue color).
* **Immediate Feedback:** For every action (like clicking a button), provide a reaction (a loader, a color change, or a sound). Never leave the user wondering if their click worked.
* **Accessibility (WCAG):** Ensure a minimum contrast ratio of **4.5:1** for normal text to make it readable for people with visual impairments.

## 5. The "Laws of Cleanliness"

* **Whitespace is a Tool:** Don’t be afraid of "empty" space. It helps group related items and prevents cognitive overload.
* **Consistency is King:** Buttons, icons, and spacing must be identical across all pages. If the "Submit" button is rounded on page one, it shouldn't be square on page two.

> **Pro-Tip:** Rules are meant to be understood so you know when it is appropriate to break them. Once you master these, you can start bending them to create a unique "brand personality."
